Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism is java through which we can use the fields and methods from one
 class to other class
without re-writing a single of code/repeating the code from the class which we are inheriting
Benefits of using inheritance :
1) Cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution
2)It helps use reduce duplicate code
3)save time
4)reusing the same code again
Disadvantages:
tight couping
classes are tightly coupled changes in parent class effect child class
Class Parent {

int money;
void print(){
sout: "Money = " + money;
}
}

class Child extends Parent{
}

main(){
Child child = new Child();
child.print();
}
}
 we can access our  static fields and methods using class names and using objects
 of the class by using Class name  is preferable because static methods and fields
 belong to class not to objects

 in inheritance when we create an object of a class all of the default constructors
 from parent class will get executed
