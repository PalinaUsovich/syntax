Abstraction :
Its a process of hiding implementation details and
showing only the important info to the user

there are 2 Types of abstraction:
1)Using the Abstract classes
2)Using the Interfaces
in Java so far we have implemented complete methods where we needed them

when we create objects of child classes all parents classes will be initialized, even of abstract
by using final KeyWord we will not inherit this class or override the method (class wont get initialize)


Key Points:
Abstract class:
1. can have abstract and completed (non-abstract methods)
2. can have constructors
3. can have static and instance variables

4. can  have static  and NON-static methods and fields
5. can have final methods fields
6. abstract methods can not  have static modifier and can not be private
7. we can not make them final
8. we can not create objects of Abstract class!!!!



we can achieve abstraction in java in two ways
1) Abstract classes and other one is Interfaces
Abstract classes can have abstract methods we can implement those abstract methods in our child classes
rules to follow:
we can have as many abstract methods as we want in a class

1)TO declare an abstract we can use abstract keyword
2)we cannot have abstract methods as private bc they will never be inherited and we will not be able to provide
implementation for those methods
3) we can not declare declare our methods as final bc final methods can never be overridden
abstract class ParentClass{

public abstract method1();
