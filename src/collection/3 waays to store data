3 ways to store data using java:
1)variable (we can store only one value)
2)Arrays ( The can store multiple objects but they are fixed in size)
3)Collection (Can store multiple objects and they are dynamic can grow and shrink the size at runtime
we can not use primitives with collections. Collections can be used with objects only
 wrapper classes:
 are classes from Java that help us use Collections with our primotive types
  as they are objects they also have many built-in methods to manipulate the data types for
  example converting a string to an Integer
  String number = "10";
  int num = Integer.parseInt(number)
  ListInterface:

Iterator is an interface that lets us iterate through any collection. it has 3 methods
hasNext()
next()
remove()

All of the collection classes they have a method iterator() using this method i can move forward in list using
above commands, and we can remove using iterator.
NOTE:
iterators can be used only once. Once we have used the iterator , we need a new one.
if we want to iterate the collection again
