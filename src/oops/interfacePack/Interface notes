Interfaces:
its a way to achieve 100% polymorphism .
always have fields as PUBLIC STATIC FINAL (by default) because we will never be creating an object of this class
which means we cannot change them , can only access them

Methods in interface are always  public abstract (by default) will be added automatically

Its a mechanism to achieve100% abstraction in Java
we can achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance using the interfaces.
we use interface when we know nothing about implementation and we only know
about the functionality
1)An interface gave all of the fields as public static final by defaoult and we can not create instance fields
WHY because we can not create object of Interface. If we try to declare the fields as anything other than public static final
or we will get an error. they are widely used to support lambdas
3)Any class who implements the Interface has to provide the implementation for the abstract methods or we can declare that class
as abstract
