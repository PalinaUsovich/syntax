String objects are immutable: means unmodifiable or unchangeable

Once string object is created its data or state cannot be changed but a new string object is created

String - if DATA is not changing , its stable , is slow because it keeps in create
new strings every time it creates new instance, when you concat too many

StringBuilder -if data is changing a lot , its fast and consume less memory when you concat strings
