4 pillars of OOP to support programming
1)Inheritance
2)polymorphism
3)Abstraction
4)Encapsulation

1)Inheritance:
is a mechanism to refer functions
 and fields of parents class to subclasses. It is a process where on class acquires
 the properties and methods of another class
 2)Polymorphism:
 the ability of the objects to take many forms
 being able to do multiple functions using name reference variable
 but with different objects
 process when object can perform actions in different way
 There are two types of Polymorphism runtime/dynamic late binding and compile time early binding or static
 we can achieve compile time polymorphism using method overloading
 we  can achieve dynamic or runtime binding polymorphism using method overriding
 3)Abstraction
 abstraction is a process of showing the functionality to the user but hiding the processes or implementation details
 behind it
 To implement Abstraction (abstract)

 If we have declared a class as abstract, we can not create objects of that class
