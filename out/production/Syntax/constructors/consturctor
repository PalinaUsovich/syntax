Constructors:
1)Is a special block of code/similar to a method that is executed
2)when we create an object of the class
3)the purpose of constructors is to initialize our fields
4)they must name same as name of the class
5)constructors do not have return types not even void
6)we can pass arguments  to our constructors just like we do for our methods

similarities between constructors and methods

1)Both can have parameters
2)both can have access modifiers (private/public/default/protected
3) can call methods

Difference constructors vs methods

1)We can name constructor only with a class name , methods can have any names
2)Constructors can not have any return type, methods must have return type
3)Constructors are automatically called when instance of the class is created

When should we use a constructors?
when we want to control the initialization for our fields
